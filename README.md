# Red_Black_Tree
A Red-Black Tree is a self balancing Binary Search Tree. It is useful in the Linux kernel design. For example in a process scheduler or for keeping track of the virtual memory segments for a process, it's used. It is also used in map, multimap, multiset from C++ STL and java.util.TreeMap , java.util.TreeSet from Java. Besides it's used in K-mean clustering algorithm for reducing time complexity. Whatâ€™s more MySQL uses Red-Black Trees for indexes on tables. In this project, basic operations with Red-Black Tree like insertion, deletion, searching etc. are performed.
